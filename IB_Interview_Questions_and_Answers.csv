1,Accounting,Basic,Walk me through the 3 financial statements. ,"The 3 major financial statements are the Income Statement, Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Statement.

The Income Statement gives the company’s revenue and expenses, and goes down to Net Income, the final line on the statement.

The Balance Sheet shows the company’s Assets – its resources – such as Cash, Inventory and PP&E, as well as its Liabilities – such as Debt and Accounts Payable – and Shareholders’ Equity. Assets must equal Liabilities plus Shareholders’ Equity.

The Cash Flow Statement begins with Net Income, adjusts for non-cash expenses and working capital changes, and then lists cash flow from investing and financing activities; at the end, you see the company’s net change in cash."
2,Accounting,Basic,Can you give examples of major line items on each of the financial statements?,"Income Statement: Revenue; Cost of Goods Sold; SG&A (Selling, General & Administrative Expenses); Operating Income; Pretax Income; Net Income. 

Balance Sheet: Cash; Accounts Receivable; Inventory; Plants, Property & Equipment (PP&E); Accounts Payable; Accrued Expenses; Debt; Shareholders Equity.  

Cash Flow Statement: Net Income; Depreciation & Amortization; Stock-Based Compensation; Changes in Operating Assets & Liabilities; Cash Flow From Operations; Capital Expenditures; Cash Flow From Investing; Sale/Purchase of Securities; Dividends Issued; Cash Flow From Financing."
3,Accounting,Basic,How do the 3 statements link together?,"To tie the statements together, Net Income from the Income Statement flows into Shareholders Equity on the Balance Sheet, and into the top line of the Cash Flow Statement. 

Changes to Balance Sheet items appear as working capital changes on the Cash Flow Statement, and investing and financing activities affect Balance Sheet items such as PP&E, Debt and Shareholders Equity. 

The Cash and Shareholders Equity items on the Balance Sheet act as plugs, with Cash flowing in from the final line on the Cash Flow Statement."
4,Accounting,Basic,"If I were stranded on a desert island, only had 1 statement and I wanted to review the overall health of a company  which statement would I use and why?","You would use the Cash Flow Statement because it gives a true picture of how much cash the company is actually generating, independent of all the non-cash expenses you might have.  And that's the #1 thing you care about when analyzing the overall financial health of any business its cash flow.  "
5,Accounting,Basic,Let's say I could only look at 2 statements to assess a company's prospects  which 2 would I use and why?,"You would pick the Income Statement and Balance Sheet, because you can create the Cash Flow Statement from both of those (assuming, of course that you have before and after versions of the Balance Sheet that correspond to the same period the Income Statement is tracking).  "
6,Accounting,Basic,Walk me through how Depreciation going up by $10 would affect the statements. ,"Income Statement: Operating Income would decline by $10 and assuming a 40% tax rate, Net Income would go down by $6. 

Cash Flow Statement: The Net Income at the top goes down by $6, but the $10 Depreciation is a non-cash expense that gets added back, so overall Cash Flow from Operations goes up by $4. There are no changes elsewhere, so the overall Net Change in Cash goes up by $4. 

Balance Sheet: Plants, Property & Equipment goes down by $10 on the Assets side because of the Depreciation, and Cash is up by $4 from the changes on the Cash Flow Statement.  Overall, Assets is down by $6.  Since Net Income fell by $6 as well, Shareholders' Equity on the Liabilities & Shareholders' Equity side is down by $6 and both sides of the Balance Sheet balance. 

Note: With this type of question I always recommend going in the order:  1. Income Statement 2. Cash Flow Statement 3. Balance Sheet  This is so you can check yourself at the end and make sure the Balance Sheet balances.  Remember that an Asset going up decreases your Cash Flow, whereas a Liability going up increases your Cash Flow."
7,Accounting,Basic,"If Depreciation is a non-cash expense, why does it affect the cash balance?","Although Depreciation is a non-cash expense, it is tax-deductible.  Since taxes are a cash expense, Depreciation affects cash by reducing the amount of taxes you pay."
8,Accounting,Basic,Where does Depreciation usually show up on the Income Statement?,"It could be in a separate line item, or it could be embedded in Cost of Goods Sold or Operating Expenses  every company does it differently. Note that the end result for accounting questions is the same: Depreciation always reduces Pre-Tax Income."
9,Accounting,Basic,What happens when Accrued Compensation goes up by $10?,"For this question, confirm that the accrued compensation is now being recognized as an expense (as opposed to just changing non-accrued to accrued compensation).  

Assuming that's the case, Operating Expenses on the Income Statement go up by $10, Pre-Tax Income falls by $10, and Net Income falls by $6 (assuming a 40% tax rate).  

On the Cash Flow Statement, Net Income is down by $6, and Accrued Compensation will increase Cash Flow by $10, so overall Cash Flow from Operations is up by $4 and the Net Change in Cash at the bottom is up by $4.  

On the Balance Sheet, Cash is up by $4 as a result, so Assets are up by $4. On the Liabilities & Equity side, Accrued Compensation is a liability so Liabilities are up by $10 and Retained Earnings are down by $6 due to the Net Income, so both sides balance."
10,Accounting,Basic," What happens when Inventory goes up by $10, assuming you pay for it with cash?","No changes to the Income Statement.  

On the Cash Flow Statement, Inventory is an asset so that decreases your Cash Flow from Operations  it goes down by $10, as does the Net Change in Cash at the bottom.

On the Balance Sheet under Assets, Inventory is up by $10 but Cash is down by $10, so the changes cancel out and Assets still equals Liabilities & Shareholders Equity."
11,Accounting,Basic, Why is the Income Statement not affected by changes in Inventory?,"This is a common interview mistake incorrectly stating that Working Capital changes show up on the Income Statement.  In the case of Inventory, the expense is only recorded when the goods associated with it are sold  so if its just sitting in a warehouse, it does not count as a Cost of Good Sold or Operating Expense until the company manufactures it into a product and sells it."
12,Accounting,Basic," Lets say Apple is buying $100 worth of new iPod factories with debt.  How are all 3 statements affected at the start of Year 1, before anything else happens? ","At the start of Year 1, before anything else has happened, there would be no changes on Apple's Income Statement (yet). 

On the Cash Flow Statement, the additional investment in factories would show up under Cash Flow from Investing as a net reduction in Cash Flow (so Cash Flow is down by $100 so far). And the additional $100 worth of debt raised would show up as an addition to Cash Flow, canceling out the investment activity.  So the cash number stays the same.  

On the Balance Sheet, there is now an additional $100 worth of factories in the Plants, Property & Equipment line, so PP&E is up by $100 and Assets is therefore up by $100. On the other side, debt is up by $100 as well and so both sides balance.  "
13,Accounting,Basic,"Now lets go out 1 year, to the start of Year 2.  Assume the debt is high-yield so no principal is paid off, and assume an interest rate of 10%.  Also assume the factories depreciate at a rate of 10% per year.  What happens?","After a year has passed, Apple must pay interest expense and must record the depreciation.  Operating Income would decrease by $10 due to the 10% depreciation charge each year, and the $10 in additional Interest Expense would decrease the Pre-Tax Income by $20 altogether ($10 from the depreciation and $10 from Interest Expense).  Assuming a tax rate of 40%, Net Income would fall by $12.

On the Cash Flow Statement, Net Income at the top is down by $12.  Depreciation is a non-cash expense, so you add it back and the end result is that Cash Flow from Operations is down by $2.  Thats the only change on the Cash Flow Statement, so overall Cash is down by $2.

On the Balance Sheet, under Assets, Cash is down by $2 and PP&E is down by $10 due to the depreciation, so overall Assets are down by $12.  On the other side, since Net Income was down by $12, Shareholders Equity is also down by $12 and both sides balance.  Remember, the debt number under Liabilities does not change since weve assumed none of the debt is actually paid back.      81   "
14,Accounting,Basic,"At the start of Year 3, the factories all break down and the value of the equipment is written down to $0.  The loan must also be paid back now.  Walk me through the 3 statements.","After 2 years, the value of the factories is now $80 if we go with the 10% depreciation per year assumption.  It is this $80 that we will write down in the 3 statements.  First, on the Income Statement, the $80 write-down shows up in the Pre-Tax Income line. With a 40% tax rate, Net Income declines by $48.  

On the Cash Flow Statement, Net Income is down by $48 but the write-down is a non- cash expense, so we add it back  and therefore Cash Flow from Operations increases by $32.  There are no changes under Cash Flow from Investing, but under Cash Flow from Financing there is a $100 charge for the loan payback  so Cash Flow from Investing falls by $100. Overall, the Net Change in Cash falls by $68.  

On the Balance Sheet, Cash is now down by $68 and PP&E is down by $80, so Assets have decreased by $148 altogether.  On the other side, Debt is down $100 since it was paid off, and since Net Income was down by $48, Shareholders Equity is down by $48 as well.  Altogether, Liabilities & Shareholders Equity are down by $148 and both sides balance. "
15,Accounting,Basic,"Now lets look at a different scenario and assume Apple is ordering $10 of additional iPod inventory, using cash on hand.  They order the inventory, but they have not manufactured or sold anything yet  what happens to the 3 statements?","No changes to the Income Statement.

Cash Flow Statement  Inventory is up by $10, so Cash Flow from Operations decreases by $10.  There are no further changes, so overall Cash is down by $10.

On the Balance Sheet, Inventory is up by $10 and Cash is down by $10 so the Assets number stays the same and the Balance Sheet remains in balance.      82    "
16,Accounting,Basic,"Now lets say they sell the iPods for revenue of $20, at a cost of $10.  Walk me through the 3 statements under this scenario.","Income Statement: Revenue is up by $20 and COGS is up by $10, so Gross Profit is up by $10 and Operating Income is up by $10 as well.  Assuming a 40% tax rate, Net Income is up by $6.

Cash Flow Statement: Net Income at the top is up by $6 and Inventory has decreased by $10 (since we just manufactured the inventory into real iPods), which is a net addition to cash flow  so Cash Flow from Operations is up by $16 overall.  These are the only changes on the Cash Flow Statement, so Net Change in Cash is up by $16.

On the Balance Sheet, Cash is up by $16 and Inventory is down by $10, so Assets is up by $6 overall.  On the other side, Net Income was up by $6 so Shareholders Equity is up by $6 and both sides balance."
17,Accounting,Basic, Could you ever end up with negative shareholders equity?  What does it mean?,"Yes.  It is common to see this in 2 scenarios:  

1. Leveraged Buyouts with dividend recapitalizations  it means that the owner of the company has taken out a large portion of its equity (usually in the form of cash), which can sometimes turn the number negative.

2. It can also happen if the company has been losing money consistently and therefore has a declining Retained Earnings balance, which is a portion of Shareholders Equity.  It doesnt mean anything in particular, but it can be a cause for concern and possibly demonstrate that the company is struggling (in the second scenario).  Note: Shareholders equity never turns negative immediately after an LBO  it would only happen following a dividend recap or continued net losses."
18,Accounting,Basic, What is working capital? How is it used?,"Working Capital = Current Assets  Current Liabilities.  If its positive, it means a company can pay off its short-term liabilities with its short- term assets. It is often presented as a financial metric and its magnitude and sign (negative or positive) tells you whether or not the company is sound.

Bankers look at Operating Working Capital more commonly in models, and that is defined as (Current Assets  Cash & Cash Equivalents)  (Current Liabilities  Debt)."
19,Accounting,Basic, What does negative Working Capital mean? Is that a bad sign?,"Not necessarily. It depends on the type of company and the specific situation  here are a few different things it could mean:  

1. Some companies with subscriptions or longer-term contracts often have negative Working Capital because of high Deferred Revenue balances. 

2. Retail and restaurant companies like Amazon, Wal-Mart, and McDonalds often have negative Working Capital because customers pay upfront  so they can use the cash generated to pay off their Accounts Payable rather than keeping a large cash balance on-hand. This can be a sign of business efficiency.

3. In other cases, negative Working Capital could point to financial trouble or possible bankruptcy (for example, when customers dont pay quickly and upfront and the company is carrying a high debt balance). "
20,Accounting,Basic,"Recently, banks have been writing down their assets and taking huge quarterly losses. Walk me through what happens on the 3 statements when theres a write- down of $100.  ","First, on the Income Statement, the $100 write-down shows up in the Pre-Tax Income line.  With a 40% tax rate, Net Income declines by $60.

On the Cash Flow Statement, Net Income is down by $60 but the write-down is a non- cash expense, so we add it back  and therefore Cash Flow from Operations increases by $40.  Overall, the Net Change in Cash rises by $40.

On the Balance Sheet, Cash is now up by $40 and an asset is down by $100 (its not clear which asset since the question never stated the specific asset to write-down).  Overall, the Assets side is down by $60.  On the other side, since Net Income was down by $60, Shareholders Equity is also down by $60  and both sides balance.  "
21,Accounting,Basic,Walk me through a $100 bailout of a company and how it affects the 3 statements. ," First, confirm what type of bailout this is: Debt? Equity? A combination? 

The most common scenario here is an equity investment from the government, so here's what happens:  

No changes to the Income Statement. 

On the Cash Flow Statement, Cash Flow from Financing goes up by $100 to reflect the government's investment, so the Net Change in Cash is up by $100.  

On the Balance Sheet, Cash is up by $100 so Assets are up by $100; on the other side, Shareholders Equity would go up by $100 to make it balance. "
22,Accounting,Basic,"Walk me through a $100 write-down of debt  as in OWED debt, a liability  on a companys balance sheet and how it affects the 3 statements.","This is counter-intuitive. When a liability is written down you record it as a gain on the Income Statement (with an asset write-down, its a loss)  so Pre-Tax Income goes up by $100 due to this write-down. Assuming a 40% tax rate, Net Income is up by $60.  

On the Cash Flow Statement, Net Income is up by $60, but we need to subtract that debt write-down  so Cash Flow from Operations is down by $40, and Net Change in Cash is down by $40.  

On the Balance Sheet, Cash is down by $40 so Assets are down by $40. On the other side, Debt is down by $100 but Shareholders Equity is up by $60 because the Net Income was up by $60  so Liabilities & Shareholders Equity is down by $40 and it balances. If this seems strange to you, you're not alone."
23,Accounting,Basic, When would a company collect cash from a customer and not record it as revenue?,"Three examples come to mind:  

1. Web-based subscription software. 

2. Cell phone carriers that sell annual contracts. 

3. Magazine publishers that sell subscriptions.  Companies that agree to services in the future often collect cash upfront to ensure stable revenue  this makes investors happy as well since they can better predict a companys performance.  Per the rules of GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles), you only record revenue when you actually perform the services  so the company would not record everything as revenue right away."
24,Accounting,Basic," If cash collected is not recorded as revenue, what happens to it?","Usually it goes into the Deferred Revenue balance on the Balance Sheet under Liabilities.  Over time, as the services are performed, the Deferred Revenue balance turns into real revenue on the Income Statement."
25,Accounting,Basic, Whats the difference between accounts receivable and deferred revenue?,"Accounts receivable has not yet been collected in cash from customers, whereas deferred revenue has been.  Accounts receivable represents how much revenue the company is waiting on, whereas deferred revenue represents how much it is waiting to record as revenue."
26,Accounting,Basic,How long does it usually take for a company to collect its accounts receivable balance? ,"Generally the accounts receivable days are in the 40-50 day range, though it's higher for companies selling high-end items and it might be lower for smaller, lower transaction- value companies."
27,Accounting,Basic, Whats the difference between cash-based and accrual accounting?,Cash-based accounting recognizes revenue and expenses when cash is actually received or paid out; accrual accounting recognizes revenue when collection is reasonably certain (i.e. after a customer has ordered the product) and recognizes expenses when they are incurred rather than when they are paid out in cash. Most large companies use accrual accounting because paying with credit cards and lines of credit is so prevalent these days; very small businesses may use cash-based accounting to simplify their financial statements. 
28,Accounting,Basic,Lets say a customer pays for a TV with a credit card.  What would this look like under cash-based vs. accrual accounting? ,"In cash-based accounting, the revenue would not show up until the company charges the customers credit card, receives authorization, and deposits the funds in its bank account  at which point it would show up as both Revenue on the Income Statement and Cash on the Balance Sheet.  In accrual accounting, it would show up as Revenue right away but instead of appearing in Cash on the Balance Sheet, it would go into Accounts Receivable at first. Then, once the cash is actually deposited in the companys bank account, it would turn into Cash."
29,Accounting,Basic, How do you decide when to capitalize rather than expense a purchase?,"If the asset has a useful life of over 1 year, it is capitalized (put on the Balance Sheet rather than shown as an expense on the Income Statement).  Then it is depreciated (tangible assets) or amortized (intangible assets) over a certain number of years.  Purchases like factories, equipment and land all last longer than a year and therefore show up on the Balance Sheet.  Employee salaries and the cost of manufacturing products (COGS) only cover a short period of operations and therefore show up on the Income Statement as normal expenses instead."
30,Accounting,Basic, Why do companies report both GAAP and non-GAAP (or Pro Forma) earnings?,"These days, many companies have non-cash charges such as Amortization of Intangibles, Stock-Based Compensation, and Deferred Revenue Write-down in their Income Statements.  As a result, some argue that Income Statements under GAAP no longer reflect how profitable most companies truly are.  Non-GAAP earnings are almost always higher because these expenses are excluded."
31,Accounting,Basic," A company has had positive EBITDA for the past 10 years, but it recently went bankrupt. How could this happen? ","Several possibilities:  

1. The company is spending too much on Capital Expenditures  these are not reflected at all in EBITDA, but it could still be cash-flow negative. 

2. The company has high interest expense and is no longer able to afford its debt. 

3. The companys debt all matures on one date and it is unable to refinance it due to a credit crunch  and it runs out of cash completely when paying back the debt. 

4. It has significant one-time charges (from litigation, for example) and those are high enough to bankrupt the company.  Remember, EBITDA excludes investment in (and depreciation of) long-term assets, interest and one-time charges  and all of these could end up bankrupting the company."
32,Accounting,Basic,Normally Goodwill remains constant on the Balance Sheet  why would it be impaired and what does Goodwill Impairment mean?,"Usually this happens when a company has been acquired and the acquirer re-assesses its intangible assets (such as customers, brand, and intellectual property) and finds that they are worth significantly less than they originally thought.  It often happens in acquisitions where the buyer overpaid for the seller and can result in a large net loss on the Income Statement (see: eBay/Skype).  It can also happen when a company discontinues part of its operations and must impair the associated goodwill."
33,Accounting,Basic, Under what circumstances would Goodwill increase?,"Technically Goodwill can increase if the company re-assesses its value and finds that it is worth more, but that is rare.  What usually happens is 1 of 2 scenarios:  

1. The company gets acquired or bought out and Goodwill changes as a result, since its an accounting plug for the purchase price in an acquisition. 

2. The company acquires another company and pays more than what its assets are worth  this is then reflected in the Goodwill number. Accounting Questions & Answers  Advanced  These more advanced questions cover topics like deferred tax assets and liabilities and how to actually project a company's financial statements in an operating model.  You may get some of these in investment banking interviews, but theyre more common if youve had significant finance experience or youre interviewing for private equity, or with a more technical group."
1,Accounting,Advanced,How is GAAP accounting different from tax accounting?,"1. GAAP is accrual-based but tax is cash-based. 
2. GAAP uses straight-line depreciation or a few other methods whereas tax accounting is different (accelerated depreciation). 
3. GAAP is more complex and more accurately tracks assets/liabilities whereas tax accounting is only concerned with revenue/expenses in the current period and what income tax you owe."
2,Accounting,Advanced,What are deferred tax assets/liabilities and how do they arise?,"They arise because of temporary differences between what a company can deduct for cash tax purposes vs. what they can deduct for book tax purposes.  Deferred Tax Liabilities arise when you have a tax expense on the Income Statement but havent actually paid that tax in cold, hard cash yet; Deferred Tax Assets arise when you pay taxes in cash but haven't expensed them on the Income Statement yet.  Theyre most common with asset write-ups and write-downs in M&A deals  an asset write-up will produce a deferred tax liability while a write-down will produce a deferred tax asset (see the Merger Model section for more on this). "
3,Accounting,Advanced,Walk me through how you create a revenue model for a company.," There are 2 ways you could do this: a bottoms-up build and a tops-down build.

Bottoms-Up: Start with individual products / customers, estimate the average sale value or customer value, and then the growth rate in sales and sale values to tie everything together. 

Tops-Down: Start with big-picture metrics like overall market size, then estimate the companys market share and how that will change in coming years, and multiply to get to their revenue.  

Of these two methods, bottoms-up is more common and is taken more seriously because estimating big-picture numbers is almost impossible."
4,Accounting,Advanced,Walk me through how you create an expense model for a company. ,"To do a true bottoms-up build, you start with each different department of a company, the # of employees in each, the average salary, bonuses, and benefits, and then make assumptions on those going forward.  Usually you assume that the number of employees is tied to revenue, and then you assume growth rates for salary, bonuses, benefits, and other metrics.  Cost of Goods Sold should be tied directly to Revenue and each unit produced should incur an expense.  Other items such as rent, Capital Expenditures, and miscellaneous expenses are either linked to the companys internal plans for building expansion plans (if they have them), or to Revenue for a more simple model. "
5,Accounting,Advanced, Lets say were trying to create these models but dont have enough information or the company doesnt tell us enough in its filings  what do we do?,"Use estimates. For the revenue if you dont have enough information to look at separate product lines or divisions of the company, you can just assume a simple growth rate into future years.  For the expenses, if you dont have employee-level information then you can just assume that major expenses like SG&A are a percent of revenue and carry that assumption forward."
6,Accounting,Advanced,Walk me through the major items in Shareholders Equity.,"Common items include:  
Common Stock  Simply the par value of however much stock the company has issued.
Retained Earnings  How much of the companys Net Income it has saved up over time.
Additional Paid in Capital This keeps track of how much stock-based compensation has been issued and how much new stock employees exercising options have created. It also includes how much over par value a company raises in an IPO or other equity offering.
Treasury Stock The dollar amount of shares that the company has bought back.
Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income this is a catch-all that includes other items that dont fit anywhere else, like the effect of foreign currency exchange rates changing. "
7,Accounting,Advanced,Walk me through what flows into Retained Earnings.,"Retained Earnings = Old Retained Earnings Balance + Net Income  Dividends Issued  If youre calculating Retained Earnings for the current year, take last years Retained Earnings number, add this years Net Income, and subtract however much the company paid out in dividends."
8,Accounting,Advanced,Walk me through what flows into Additional Paid-In Capital (APIC).,"APIC = Old APIC + Stock-Based Compensation + Value of Stock Created by Option Exercises  Take the balance from last year, add this years stock-based compensation number, and then add in the value of new stock created by employees exercising options this year."
9,Accounting,Advanced,What is the Statement of Shareholders Equity and why do we use it?,"This statement shows everything we went through above  the major items that comprise Shareholders Equity, and how we arrive at each of them using the numbers elsewhere in the statement.  You dont use it too much, but it can be helpful for analyzing companies with unusual stock-based compensation and stock option situations. "
10,Accounting,Advanced,What are examples of non-recurring charges we need to add back to a companys EBIT / EBITDA when looking at its financial statements?,"Restructuring Charges  Goodwill Impairment  Asset Write-Downs  Bad Debt Expenses  Legal Expenses  Disaster Expenses  Change in Accounting Procedures Note that to be an add-back or non-recurring charge for EBITDA / EBIT purposes, it needs to affect Operating Income on the Income Statement. So if you have one of these charges below the line then you do not add it back for the EBITDA / EBIT calculation.  Also note that you do add back Depreciation, Amortization, and sometimes Stock-Based Compensation for EBITDA / EBIT, but that these are not non-recurring charges because all companies have them every year  these are just non-cash charges. "
11,Accounting,Advanced,How do you project Balance Sheet items like Accounts Receivable and Accrued Expenses in a 3-statement model?," Normally you make very simple assumptions and assume these are percentages of revenue, operating expenses, or cost of goods sold. 

Examples:   Accounts Receivable: % of revenue.  Deferred Revenue: % of revenue.  Accounts Payable: % of COGS.  Accrued Expenses: % of operating expenses or SG&A.  Then you either carry the same percentages across in future years or assume slight changes depending on the company."
12,Accounting,Advanced, How should you project Depreciation and Capital Expenditures?,"The simple way: project each one as a % of revenue or previous PP&E balance.The more complex way: create a PP&E schedule that splits out different assets by their useful lives, assumes straight-line depreciation over each assets useful life, and then assumes capital expenditures based on what the company has invested historically."
13,Accounting,Advanced, How do Net Operating Losses (NOLs) affect a companys 3 statements?,"The quick and dirty way to do this: reduce the Taxable Income by the portion of the NOLs that you can use each year, apply the same tax rate, and then subtract that new Tax number from your old Pretax Income number (which should stay the same).  

The way you should do this: create a book vs. cash tax schedule where you calculate the Taxable Income based on NOLs, and then look at what you would pay in taxes without the NOLs.  Then you book the difference as an increase to the Deferred Tax Liability on the Balance Sheet.  This method reflects the fact that youre saving on cash flow  since the DTL, a liability, is rising  but correctly separates the NOL impact into book vs. cash taxes."
14,Accounting,Advanced, Whats the difference between capital leases and operating leases?,"Operating leases are used for short-term leasing of equipment and property, and do not involve ownership of anything. Operating lease expenses show up as operating expenses on the Income Statement.  Capital leases are used for longer-term items and give the lessee ownership rights; they depreciate and incur interest payments, and are counted as debt.  A lease is a capital lease if any one of the following 4 conditions is true:  

1. If theres a transfer of ownership at the end of the term. 
2. If theres an option to purchase the asset at a bargain price at the end of the term. 
3. If the term of the lease is greater than 75% of the useful life of the asset. 
4. If the present value of the lease payments is greater than 90% of the assets fair market value."
15,Accounting,Advanced,Why would the Depreciation & Amortization number on the Income Statement be different from whats on the Cash Flow Statement?,"This happens if D&A is embedded in other Income Statement line items. When this happens, you need to use the Cash Flow Statement number to arrive at EBITDA because otherwise youre undercounting D&A. Enterprise / Equity Value Questions & Answers  Basic  For the most part, Enterprise Value and Equity Value questions are straightforward. Just make sure you know all the relevant formulas and understand concepts like the Treasury Stock Method for calculating diluted shares."
1,Enterprise/Equity Value,Basic,Why do we look at both Enterprise Value and Equity Value?,"Enterprise Value represents the value of the company that is attributable to all investors; Equity Value only represents the portion available to shareholders (equity investors). You look at both because Equity Value is the number the public-at-large sees, while Enterprise Value represents its true value."
2,Enterprise/Equity Value,Basic,"When looking at an acquisition of a company, do you pay more attention to Enterprise or Equity Value?","Enterprise Value, because thats how much an acquirer really pays and includes the often mandatory debt repayment."
3,Enterprise/Equity Value,Basic,Whats the formula for Enterprise Value?,"EV = Equity Value + Debt + Preferred Stock + Minority Interest - Cash  (This formula does not tell the whole story and can get more complex  see the Advanced Questions. Most of the time you can get away with stating this formula in an interview, though)."
4,Enterprise/Equity Value,Basic,Why do you need to add Minority Interest to Enterprise Value?,"Whenever a company owns over 50% of another company, it is required to report the financial performance of the other company as part of its own performance.  So even though it doesnt own 100%, it reports 100% of the majority-owned subsidiarys financial performance.  In keeping with the apples-to-apples theme, you must add Minority Interest to get to Enterprise Value so that your numerator and denominator both reflect 100% of the majority-owned subsidiary. "
5,Enterprise/Equity Value,Basic,How do you calculate fully diluted shares?,"Take the basic share count and add in the dilutive effect of stock options and any other dilutive securities, such as warrants, convertible debt or convertible preferred stock.  To calculate the dilutive effect of options, you use the Treasury Stock Method (detail on this below). "
6,Enterprise/Equity Value,Basic,"Lets say a company has 100 shares outstanding, at a share price of $10 each.  It also has 10 options outstanding at an exercise price of $5 each  what is its fully diluted equity value?  ","Its basic equity value is $1,000 (100 * $10 = $1,000).  To calculate the dilutive effect of the options, first you note that the options are all in-the-money  their exercise price is less than the current share price.  When these options are exercised, there will be 10 new shares created  so the share count is now 110 rather than 100.  However, that doesnt tell the whole story.  In order to exercise the options, we had to pay the company $5 for each option (the exercise price).  As a result, it now has $50 in additional cash, which it now uses to buy back 5 of the new shares we created.  So the fully diluted share count is 105, and the fully diluted equity value is $1,050. "
7,Enterprise/Equity Value,Basic,"Lets say a company has 100 shares outstanding, at a share price of $10 each.  It also has 10 options outstanding at an exercise price of $15 each  what is its fully diluted equity value?  ","$1,000.  In this case the options exercise price is above the current share price, so they have no dilutive effect. "
8,Enterprise/Equity Value,Basic,Why do you subtract cash in the formula for Enterprise Value?  Is that always accurate?,"The official reason: Cash is subtracted because its considered a non-operating asset and because Equity Value implicitly accounts for it.  

The way I think about it: In an acquisition, the buyer would get the cash of the seller, so it effectively pays less for the company based on how large its cash balance is. Remember, Enterprise Value tells us how much youd really have to pay to acquire another company.  Its not always accurate because technically you should be subtracting only excess cash  the amount of cash a company has above the minimum cash it requires to operate."
9,Enterprise/Equity Value,Basic,Is it always accurate to add Debt to Equity Value when calculating Enterprise Value?,"In most cases, yes, because the terms of a debt agreement usually say that debt must be refinanced in an acquisition.  And in most cases a buyer will pay off a seller's debt, so it is accurate to say that any debt adds to the purchase price.  However, there could always be exceptions where the buyer does not pay off the debt. These are rare and Ive personally never seen it, but once again never say never applies."
10,Enterprise/Equity Value,Basic, Could a company have a negative Enterprise Value?  What would that mean?,"Yes.  It means that the company has an extremely large cash balance, or an extremely low market capitalization (or both).  You see it with:  
1. Companies on the brink of bankruptcy. 
2. Financial institutions, such as banks, that have large cash balances.  These days, theres a lot of overlap in these 2 categories"
11,Enterprise/Equity Value,Basic, Could a company have a negative Equity Value?  What would that mean?,No.  This is not possible because you cannot have a negative share count and you cannot have a negative share price.
12,Enterprise/Equity Value,Basic, Why do we add Preferred Stock to get to Enterprise Value?,"Preferred Stock pays out a fixed dividend, and preferred stock holders also have a higher claim to a companys assets than equity investors do.  As a result, it is seen as more similar to debt than common stock."
13,Enterprise/Equity Value,Basic, How do you account for convertible bonds in the Enterprise Value formula?,"If the convertible bonds are in-the-money, meaning that the conversion price of the bonds is below the current share price, then you count them as additional dilution to the Equity Value; if theyre out-of-the-money then you count the face value of the convertibles as part of the companys Debt. "
14,Enterprise/Equity Value,Basic,"A company has 1 million shares outstanding at a value of $100 per share. It also has $10 million of convertible bonds, with par value of $1,000 and a conversion price of $50. How do I calculate diluted shares outstanding?","This gets confusing because of the different units involved. First, note that these convertible bonds are in-the-money because the companys share price is $100, but the conversion price is $50. So we count them as additional shares rather than debt.  Next, we need to divide the value of the convertible bonds  $10 million  by the par value  $1,000  to figure out how many individual bonds we get:  $10 million / $1,000 = 10,000 convertible bonds.  Next, we need to figure out how many shares this number represents. The number of shares per bond is the par value divided by the conversion price:  $1,000 / $50 = 20 shares per bond.  So we have 200,000 new shares (20 * 10,000) created by the convertibles, giving us 1.2 million diluted shares outstanding.  We do not use the Treasury Stock Method with convertibles because the company is not receiving any cash from us."
15,Enterprise/Equity Value,Basic, Whats the difference between Equity Value and Shareholders Equity?,"Equity Value is the market value and Shareholders Equity is the book value. Equity Value can never be negative because shares outstanding and share prices can never be negative, whereas Shareholders Equity could be any value. For healthy companies, Equity Value usually far exceeds Shareholders Equity.  Enterprise / Equity Value Questions & Answers  Advanced  These more advanced questions cover some of the problems with the traditional formula for Enterprise Value, as well as details about book value and market value. Youre not likely to get these in the standard entry-level investment banking interview, but its always good to be prepared."
1,Enterprise/Equity Value,Advanced,Are there any problems with the Enterprise Value formula you just gave me?,"Yes  its too simple. There are lots of other things you need to add into the formula with real companies:   Net Operating Losses  Should be valued and arguably added in, similar to cash.  Long-Term Investments  These should be counted, similar to cash.  Equity Investments  Any investments in other companies should also be added in, similar to cash (though they might be discounted).  Capital Leases  Like debt, these have interest payments  so they should be added in like debt.  (Some) Operating Leases  Sometimes you need to convert operating leases to capital leases and add them as well.  Unfunded Pension Obligations  Sometimes these are counted as debt as well.  So a more correct formula would be Enterprise Value = Equity Value  Cash + Debt + Preferred Stock + Minority Interest  NOLs  Investments + Capital Leases + Unfunded Pension Obligations In interviews, usually you can get away with saying Enterprise Value = Equity Value  Cash + Debt + Preferred Stock + Minority Interest  I mention this here because in more advanced interviews you might get questions on this topic."
2,Enterprise/Equity Value,Advanced,Should you use the book value or market value of each item when calculating Enterprise Value?," Technically, you should use market value for everything. In practice, however, you usually use market value only for the Equity Value portion, because its almost impossible to establish market values for the rest of the items in the formula  so you just take the numbers from the companys Balance Sheet. "
3,Enterprise/Equity Value,Advanced,What percentage dilution in Equity Value is too high?," Theres no strict rule here but most bankers would say that anything over 10% is odd. If your basic Equity Value is $100 million and the diluted Equity Value is $115 million, you might want to check your calculations  its not necessarily wrong, but over 10% dilution is unusual for most companies. These days, you need to have a better-than-average understanding of Valuation.  Forget about just knowing the 3 methodologies  you need to understand how and why theyre used, which ones produce the highest or lowest values and also keep in mind exceptions to each rule."
4,Valuation,Basic,What are the 3 major valuation methodologies?,"Comparable Companies, Precedent Transactions and Discounted Cash Flow Analysis."
5,Valuation,Basic,Rank the 3 valuation methodologies from highest to lowest expected value. ,"Trick question  there is no ranking that always holds.  In general, Precedent Transactions will be higher than Comparable Companies due to the Control Premium built into acquisitions.  Beyond that, a DCF could go either way and its best to say that its more variable than other methodologies.  Often it produces the highest value, but it can produce the lowest value as well depending on your assumptions."
6,Valuation,Basic,When would you not use a DCF in a Valuation?,"You do not use a DCF if the company has unstable or unpredictable cash flows (tech or bio-tech startup) or when debt and working capital serve a fundamentally different role. For example, banks and financial institutions do not re-invest debt and working capital is a huge part of their Balance Sheets  so you wouldnt use a DCF for such companies."
7,Valuation,Basic,What other Valuation methodologies are there?,"Other methodologies include:   
Liquidation Valuation:  Valuing a companys assets, assuming they are sold off and then subtracting liabilities to determine how much capital, if any, equity investors receive  
Replacement Value:  Valuing a company based on the cost of replacing its assets
LBO Analysis:  Determining how much a PE firm could pay for a company to hit a target IRR, usually in the 20-25% range
 Sum of the Parts: Valuing each division of a company separately and adding them together at the end
M&A Premiums Analysis: Analyzing M&A deals and figuring out the premium that each buyer paid, and using this to establish what your company is worth  
Future Share Price Analysis:  Projecting a companys share price based on the P / E multiples of the public company comparables, then discounting it back to its present value"
8,Valuation,Basic,When would you use a Liquidation Valuation?,This is most common in bankruptcy scenarios and is used to see whether equity shareholders will receive any capital after the companys debts have been paid off.  It is often used to advise struggling businesses on whether its better to sell off assets separately or to try and sell the entire company.
9,Valuation,Basic,When would you use Sum of the Parts?,"This is most often used when a company has completely different, unrelated divisions  a conglomerate like General Electric, for example.  If you have a plastics division, a TV and entertainment division, an energy division, a consumer financing division and a technology division, you should not use the same set of Comparable Companies and Precedent Transactions for the entire company.  Instead, you should use different sets for each division, value each one separately, and then add them together to get the Combined Value."
10,Valuation,Basic,When do you use an LBO Analysis as part of your Valuation?,"Obviously you use this whenever youre looking at a Leveraged Buyout  but it is also used to establish how much a private equity firm could pay, which is usually lower than what companies will pay.  It is often used to set a floor on a possible Valuation for the company youre looking at."
11,Valuation,Basic,What are the most common multiples used in Valuation?,"The most common multiples are EV/Revenue, EV/EBITDA, EV/EBIT, P/E (Share Price / Earnings per Share), and P/BV (Share Price / Book Value per Share)."
12,Valuation,Basic,What are some examples of industry-specific multiples?,"Technology (Internet): EV / Unique Visitors, EV / Pageviews  Retail / Airlines: EV / EBITDAR (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, Amortization & Rental Expense)  Energy: EV / EBITDAX (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, Amortization & Exploration Expense), EV / Daily Production, EV / Proved Reserve Quantities  Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs): Price / FFO per Share, Price / AFFO per Share (Funds From Operations, Adjusted Funds From Operations)  

Technology and Energy should be straightforward  youre looking at traffic and energy reserves as value drivers rather than revenue or profit.  

For Retail / Airlines, you add back Rent because some companies own their own buildings and capitalize the expense whereas others rent and therefore have a rental expense.  For Energy, all value is derived from companies reserves of oil & gas, which explains the last 2 multiples; EBITDAX exists because some companies capitalize (a portion of) their exploration expenses and some expense them. You add back the exploration expense to normalize the numbers. 

 For REITs, Funds From Operations is a common metric that adds back Depreciation and subtracts gains on the sale of property. Depreciation is a non-cash yet extremely large expense in real estate, and gains on sales of properties are assumed to be non-recurring, so FFO is viewed as a normalized picture of the cash flow the REIT is generating. "
13,Valuation,Basic,"10. When youre looking at an industry-specific multiple like EV / Scientists or EV / Subscribers, why do you use Enterprise Value rather than Equity Value? ","You use Enterprise Value because those scientists or subscribers are available to all the investors (both debt and equity) in a company. The same logic doesnt apply to everything, though  you need to think through the multiple and see which investors the particular metric is available to."
14,Valuation,Basic, Would an LBO or DCF give a higher valuation?," Technically it could go either way, but in most cases the LBO will give you a lower valuation.  Heres the easiest way to think about it: with an LBO, you do not get any value from the cash flows of a company in between Year 1 and the final year  youre only valuing it based on its terminal value.  With a DCF, by contrast, youre taking into account both the companys cash flows in between and its terminal value, so values tend to be higher.  Note: Unlike a DCF, an LBO model by itself does not give a specific valuation.  Instead, you set a desired IRR and determine how much you could pay for the company (the valuation) based on that."
15,Valuation,Basic,How would you present these Valuation methodologies to a company or its investors? ,Usually you use a football field chart where you show the valuation range implied by each methodology.  You always show a range rather than one specific number. 
16,Valuation,Basic, How would you value an apple tree?,"The same way you would value a company: by looking at what comparable apple trees are worth (relative valuation) and the value of the apple trees cash flows (intrinsic valuation).  Yes, you could do a DCF for anything  even an apple tree. "
17,Valuation,Basic,14. Why cant you use Equity Value / EBITDA as a multiple rather than Enterprise Value / EBITDA?,"EBITDA is available to all investors in the company  rather than just equity holders. Similarly, Enterprise Value is also available to all shareholders so it makes sense to pair them together.  Equity Value / EBITDA, however, is comparing apples to oranges because Equity Value does not reflect the companys entire capital structure  only the part available to equity investors."
18,Valuation,Basic, When would a Liquidation Valuation produce the highest value?,"This is highly unusual, but it could happen if a company had substantial hard assets but the market was severely undervaluing it for a specific reason (such as an earnings miss or cyclicality).  As a result, the companys Comparable Companies and Precedent Transactions would likely produce lower values as well  and if its assets were valued highly enough, Liquidation Valuation might give a higher value than other methodologies. "
19,Valuation,Basic,Lets go back to 2004 and look at Facebook back when it had no profit and no revenue.  How would you value it? ,"You would use Comparable Companies and Precedent Transactions and look at more creative multiples such as EV/Unique Visitors and EV/Pageviews rather than EV/Revenue or EV/EBITDA.  You would not use a far in the future DCF because you cant reasonably predict cash flows for a company that is not even making money yet.  This is a very common wrong answer given by interviewees.  When you cant predict cash flow, use other metrics  dont try to predict cash flow anyway!"
20,Valuation,Basic,What would you use in conjunction with Free Cash Flow multiples  Equity Value or Enterprise Value?," Trick question.  For Unlevered Free Cash Flow, you would use Enterprise Value, but for Levered Free Cash Flow you would use Equity Value.  Remember, Unlevered Free Cash Flow excludes Interest and thus represents money available to all investors, whereas Levered already includes Interest and the money is therefore only available to equity investors.  Debt investors have already been paid with the interest payments they received. "
21,Valuation,Basic,"You never use Equity Value / EBITDA, but are there any cases where you might use Equity Value / Revenue?","  Its very rare to see this, but sometimes large financial institutions with big cash balances have negative Enterprise Values  so you might use Equity Value / Revenue instead.  You might see Equity Value / Revenue if youve listed a set of financial institutions and non-financial institutions on a slide, youre showing Revenue multiples for the non- financial institutions, and you want to show something similar for the financial institutions.  Note, however, that in most cases you would be using other multiples such as P/E and P/BV with banks anyway."
22,Valuation,Basic, How do you select Comparable Companies / Precedent Transactions?,"The 3 main ways to select companies and transactions:  1. Industry classification 2. Financial criteria (Revenue, EBITDA, etc.) 3. Geography  For Precedent Transactions, you often limit the set based on date and only look at transactions within the past 1-2 years.  The most important factor is industry  that is always used to screen for companies/transactions, and the rest may or may not be used depending on how specific you want to be.  Here are a few examples:  Comparable Company Screen: Oil & gas producers with market caps over $5 billion. 

Comparable Company Screen: Digital media companies with over $100 million in revenue  Precedent Transaction Screen: Airline M&A transactions over the past 2 years involving sellers with over $1 billion in revenue  Precedent Transaction Screen: Retail M&A transactions over the past year "
23,Valuation,Basic,20. How do you apply the 3 valuation methodologies to actually get a value for the company youre looking at? ,"Sometimes this simple fact gets lost in discussion of Valuation methodologies.  You take the median multiple of a set of companies or transactions, and then multiply it by the relevant metric from the company youre valuing.  Example: If the median EBITDA multiple from your set of Precedent Transactions is 8x and your companys EBITDA is $500 million, the implied Enterprise Value would be $4 billion.  To get the football field valuation graph you often see, you look at the minimum, maximum, 25th percentile and 75th percentile in each set as well and create a range of values based on each methodology."
24,Valuation,Basic, What do you actually use a valuation for?,"Usually you use it in pitch books and in client presentations when youre providing updates and telling them what they should expect for their own valuation.  Its also used right before a deal closes in a Fairness Opinion, a document a bank creates that proves the value their client is paying or receiving is fair from a financial point of view.  Valuations can also be used in defense analyses, merger models, LBO models, DCFs (because terminal multiples are based off of comps), and pretty much anything else in finance. "
25,Valuation,Basic,Why would a company with similar growth and profitability to its Comparable Companies be valued at a premium? ,"This could happen for a number of reasons:   The company has just reported earnings well-above expectations and its stock price has risen recently.  It has some type of competitive advantage not reflected in its financials, such as a key patent or other intellectual property.  It has just won a favorable ruling in a major lawsuit.  It is the market leader in an industry and has greater market share than its competitors."
26,Valuation,Basic, What are the flaws with public company comparables?, No company is 100% comparable to another company.  The stock market is emotional  your multiples might be dramatically higher or lower on certain dates depending on the markets movements.  Share prices for small companies with thinly-traded stocks may not reflect their full value.
27,Valuation,Basic, How do you take into account a companys competitive advantage in a valuation?,"1. Look at the 75th percentile or higher for the multiples rather than the Medians. 
2. Add in a premium to some of the multiples. 
3. Use more aggressive projections for the company.  In practice you rarely do all of the above  these are just possibilities. "
28,Valuation,Basic,Do you ALWAYS use the median multiple of a set of public company comparables or precedent transactions?," Theres no rule that you have to do this, but in most cases you do because you want to use values from the middle range of the set. But if the company youre valuing is distressed, is not performing well, or is at a competitive disadvantage, you might use the 25th percentile or something in the lower range instead  and vice versa if its doing well."
29,Valuation,Basic,You mentioned that Precedent Transactions usually produce a higher value than Comparable Companies  can you think of a situation where this is not the case?," Sometimes this happens when there is a substantial mismatch between the M&A market and the public market.  For example, no public companies have been acquired recently but there have been a lot of small private companies acquired at extremely low valuations.  For the most part this generalization is true but there are exceptions to almost every rule in finance."
30,Valuation,Basic, What are some flaws with precedent transactions?," Past transactions are rarely 100% comparable  the transaction structure, size of the company, and market sentiment all have huge effects.  Data on precedent transactions is generally more difficult to find than it is for public company comparables, especially for acquisitions of small private companies. "
31,Valuation,Basic,"Two companies have the exact same financial profiles and are bought by the same acquirer, but the EBITDA multiple for one transaction is twice the multiple of the other transaction  how could this happen? ","Possible reasons:  
1. One process was more competitive and had a lot more companies bidding on the target. 
2. One company had recent bad news or a depressed stock price so it was acquired at a discount. 3. They were in industries with different median multiples."
32,Valuation,Basic, Why does Warren Buffett prefer EBIT multiples to EBITDA multiples?,"Warren Buffett once famously said, ""Does management think the tooth fairy pays for capital expenditures?  He dislikes EBITDA because it hides the Capital Expenditures companies make and disguises how much cash they are actually using to finance their operations.  In some industries there is also a large gap between EBIT and EBITDA  anything that is very capital-intensive, for example, will show a big disparity. Note that EBIT itself does not include Capital Expenditures, but it does include Depreciation and that is directly linked to CapEx  thats the link. If a company has a high Depreciation expense, chances are it has a high CapEx."
33,Valuation,Basic,"The EV / EBIT, EV / EBITDA, and P / E multiples all measure a companys profitability. Whats the difference between them, and when do you use each one? ","P / E depends on the companys capital structure whereas EV / EBIT and EV / EBITDA are capital structure-neutral. Therefore, you use P / E for banks, financial institutions, and other companies where interest payments / expenses are critical.  EV / EBIT includes Depreciation & Amortization whereas EV / EBITDA excludes it  youre more likely to use EV / EBIT in industries where D&A is large and where capital expenditures and fixed assets are important (e.g. manufacturing), and EV / EBITDA in industries where fixed assets are less important and where D&A is comparatively smaller (e.g. Internet companies)."
34,Valuation,Basic,"If you were buying a vending machine business, would you pay a higher multiple for a business where you owned the machines and they depreciated normally, or one in which you leased the machines?","The cost of depreciation and lease are the same dollar amounts and everything else is held constant.  You would pay more for the one where you lease the machines. Enterprise Value would be the same for both companies, but with the depreciated situation the charge is not reflected in EBITDA  so EBITDA is higher, and the EV / EBITDA multiple is lower as a result.  For the leased situation, the lease would show up in SG&A so it would be reflected in EBITDA, making EBITDA lower and the EV / EBITDA multiple higher"
35,Valuation,Basic, How do you value a private company?,"You use the same methodologies as with public companies: public company comparables, precedent transactions, and DCF. But there are some differences:   You might apply a 10-15% (or more) discount to the public company comparable multiples because the private company youre valuing is not as liquid as the public comps.  You cant use a premiums analysis or future share price analysis because a private company doesnt have a share price. Your valuation shows the Enterprise Value for the company as opposed to the implied per-share price as with public companies.  A DCF gets tricky because a private company doesnt have a market capitalization or Beta  you would probably just estimate WACC based on the public comps WACC rather than trying to calculate it."
36,Valuation,Basic,Lets say were valuing a private company. Why might we discount the public company comparable multiples but not the precedent transaction multiples?,"Theres no discount because with precedent transactions, youre acquiring the entire company  and once its acquired, the shares immediately become illiquid.  But shares  the ability to buy individual pieces of a company rather than the whole thing  can be either liquid (if its public) or illiquid (if its private).  Since shares of public companies are always more liquid, you would discount public company comparable multiples to account for this."
37,Valuation,Basic, Can you use private companies as part of your valuation?,"Only in the context of precedent transactions  it would make no sense to include them for public company comparables or as part of the Cost of Equity / WACC calculation in a DCF because they are not public and therefore have no values for market cap or Beta.  Valuation Questions & Answers  Advanced  These more advanced questions cover industry-specific valuation in more detail, as well as scenarios like IPO valuation, M&A premiums, and future share price analysis that are not likely to come up in entry-level interviews  but which could come up if youre going for more advanced positions."
1,Valuation,Advanced,How do you value banks and financial institutions differently from other companies? ,"For relative valuation, the methodologies (public comps and precedent transactions) are the same but the metrics and multiples are different:   You screen based on assets or deposits in addition to the normal criteria.  You look at metrics like ROE (Return on Equity, Net Income / Shareholders Equity), ROA (Return on Assets, Net Income / Total Assets), and Book Value and Tangible Book Value rather than Revenue, EBITDA, and so on.  You use multiples such as P / E, P / BV, and P / TBV rather than EV / EBITDA.  Rather than a traditional DCF, you use 2 different methodologies for intrinsic valuation:   In a Dividend Discount Model (DDM) you sum up the present value of a banks dividends in future years and then add it to the present value of the banks terminal value, usually basing that on a P / BV or P / TBV multiple.  In a Residual Income Model (also known as an Excess Returns Model), you take the banks current Book Value and simply add the present value of the excess returns to that Book Value to value it. The excess return each year is (ROE * Book Value)  (Cost of Equity * Book Value)  basically how much the returns exceed your expectations.  You need to use these methodologies and multiples because interest is a critical component of a banks revenue and because debt is a raw material rather than just a financing source; also, banks book values are usually very close to their market caps."
2,Valuation,Advanced,Walk me through an IPO valuation for a company thats about to go public. ,"1. Unlike normal valuations, in an IPO valuation we only care about public company comparables. 
2. After picking the public company comparables we decide on the most relevant multiple to use and then estimate our companys Enterprise Value based on that. 
3. Once we have the Enterprise Value, we work backward to get to Equity Value and also subtract the IPO proceeds because this is new cash. 
4. Then we divide by the total number of shares (old and newly created) to get its per-share price. When people say An IPO priced at this is what theyre referring to.  If you were using P / E or any other Equity Value-based multiple for the multiple in step #2 here, then you would get to Equity Value instead and then subtract the IPO proceeds from there. "
3,Valuation,Advanced,"Im looking at financial data for a public company comparable, and its April (Q2) right now. Walk me through how you would calendarize this companys financial statements to show the Trailing Twelve Months as opposed to just the last Fiscal Year. ","The formula to calendarize financial statements is as follows:  TTM = Most Recent Fiscal Year + New Partial Period  Old Partial Period  So in the example above, we would take the companys Q1 numbers, add the most recent fiscal years numbers, and then subtract the Q1 numbers from that most recent fiscal year.  For US companies you can find these quarterly numbers in the 10-Q; for international companies theyre in the interim reports."
4,Valuation,Advanced,Walk me through an M&A premiums analysis.,"The purpose of this analysis is to look at similar transactions and see the premiums that buyers have paid to sellers share prices when acquiring them. For example, if a company is trading at $10.00/share and the buyer acquires it for $15.00/share, thats a 50% premium. 
1. First, select the precedent transactions based on industry, date (past 2-3 years for example), and size (example: over $1 billion market cap). 
2. For each transaction, get the sellers share price 1 day, 20 days, and 60 days before the transaction was announced (you can also look at even longer intervals, or 30 days, 45 days, etc.). 
3. Then, calculate the 1-day premium, 20-day premium, etc. by dividing the per- share purchase price by the appropriate share prices on each day. 
4. Get the medians for each set, and then apply them to your companys current share price, share price 20 days ago, etc. to estimate how much of a premium a buyer might pay for it.  Note that you only use this analysis when valuing public companies because private companies dont have share prices. Sometimes the set of companies here is exactly the same as your set of precedent transactions but typically it is broader."
5,Valuation,Advanced,Walk me through a future share price analysis.,"The purpose of this analysis is to project what a companys share price might be 1 or 2 years from now and then discount it back to its present value.  1. Get the median historical (usually TTM) P / E of your public company comparables. 2. Apply this P / E multiple to your companys 1-year forward or 2-year forward projected EPS to get its implied future share price. 3. Then, discount this back to its present value by using a discount rate in-line with the companys Cost of Equity figures.  You normally look at a range of P / E multiples as well as a range of discount rates for this type of analysis, and make a sensitivity table with these as inputs.  "
6,Valuation,Advanced,Both M&A premiums analysis and precedent transactions involve looking at previous M&A transactions. Whats the difference in how we select them?  ," All the sellers in the M&A premiums analysis must be public.  Usually we use a broader set of transactions for M&A premiums  we might use fewer than 10 precedent transactions but we might have dozens of M&A premiums. The industry and financial screens are usually less stringent.  Aside from those, the screening criteria is similar  financial, industry, geography, and date."
7,Valuation,Advanced,Walk me through a Sum-of-the-Parts analysis. ," In a Sum-of-the-Parts analysis, you value each division of a company using separate comparables and transactions, get to separate multiples, and then add up each divisions value to get the total for the company.

 Example:  We have a manufacturing division with $100 million EBITDA, an entertainment division with $50 million EBITDA and a consumer goods division with $75 million EBITDA. Weve selected comparable companies and transactions for each division, and the median multiples come out to 5x EBITDA for manufacturing, 8x EBITDA for entertainment, and 4x EBITDA for consumer goods.  Our calculation would be $100 * 5x + $50 * 8x + $75 * 4x = $1.2 billion for the companys total value."
8,Valuation,Advanced,How do you value Net Operating Losses and take them into account in a valuation?,"You value NOLs based on how much theyll save the company in taxes in future years, and then take the present value of the sum of tax savings in future years. Two ways to assess the tax savings in future years:  

1. Assume that a company can use its NOLs to completely offset its taxable income until the NOLs run out. 

2. In an acquisition scenario, use Section 382 and multiply the adjusted long-term rate (http://pmstax.com/afr/exemptAFR.shtml) by the equity purchase price of the seller to determine the maximum allowed NOL usage in each year  and then use that to figure out the offset to taxable income.  You might look at NOLs in a valuation but you rarely add them in  if you did, they would be similar to cash and you would subtract NOLs to go from Equity Value to Enterprise Value, and vice versa."
9,Valuation,Advanced,I have a set of public company comparables and need to get the projections from equity research. How do I select which report to use?," This varies by bank and group, but two common methods:  1. You pick the report with the most detailed information. 2. You pick the report with numbers in the middle of the range. Note that you do not pick reports based on which bank theyre coming from. So if youre at Goldman Sachs, you would not pick all Goldman Sachs equity research  in fact that would be bad because then your valuation would not be objective. "
10,Valuation,Advanced,I have a set of precedent transactions but Im missing information like EBITDA for a lot of the companies  how can I find it if its not available via public sources?,"1. Search online and see if you can find press releases or articles in the financial press with these numbers. 

2. Failing that, look in equity research for the buyer around the time of the transaction and see if any of the analysts estimate the sellers numbers. 

3. Also look on online sources like Capital IQ and Factset and see if any of them disclose numbers or give estimates. "
11,Valuation,Advanced,How far back and forward do we usually go for public company comparable and precedent transaction multiples?," Usually you look at the TTM (Trailing Twelve Months) period for both sets, and then you look forward either 1 or 2 years. Youre more likely to look backward more than 1 year and go forward more than 2 years for public company comparables; for precedent transactions its odd to go forward more than 1 year because your information is more limited.  "
12,Valuation,Advanced,"I have one company with a 40% EBITDA margin trading at 8x EBITDA, and another company with a 10% EBITDA margin trading at 16x EBITDA. Whats the problem with comparing these two valuations directly? ","Theres no rule that says this is wrong or not allowed, but it can be misleading to compare companies with dramatically different margins. Due to basic arithmetic, the 40% margin company will usually have a lower multiple  whether or not its actual value is lower.  In this situation, we might consider screening based on margins and remove the outliers  you would never try to normalize the EBITDA multiples based on margins. "
13,Valuation,Advanced,Walk me through how we might value an oil & gas company and how its different from a standard company. ,"Public comps and precedent transactions are similar, but: You might screen based on metrics like Proved Reserves or Daily Production.  You would look at the above metrics as well as R/P (Proved Reserves / Last Years Production), EBITDAX, and other industry-specific ones, and use matching multiples.  You could use a standard Unlevered DCF to value an oil & gas company as well, but its also common to see a NAV (Net Asset Value) Model where you take the companys Proved Reserves, assume they produce revenue until depletion, assign a cost to the production in each year, and take the present value of those to value the company.  There are also a host of other complications: oil & gas companies are cyclical and have no control over the prices they receive, companies use either full-cost accounting or successful efforts accounting and treat the exploration expense differently, and so on.  "
14,Valuation,Advanced,Walk me through how we would value a REIT (Real Estate Investment Trust) and how it differs from a normal company.," Similar to energy, real estate is asset-intensive and a companys value depends on how much cash flow specific properties generate.   You look at Price / FFO per Share (Funds From Operations) and Price / AFFO per Share (Adjusted Funds From Operations), which add back Depreciation and subtract gains on property sales.  You value properties by dividing Net Operating Income (NOI) (Propertys Gross Income  Operating Expenses) by the capitalization rate (based on market data).  Replacement Valuation is more common because you can actually estimate the cost of buying new land and building new properties.  A DCF is still a DCF, but it flows from specific properties and it might be useless depending on what kind of company youre valuing. "
1,DCF,Basic,Walk me through a DCF.,"A DCF values a company based on the Present Value of its Cash Flows and the Present Value of its Terminal Value.  First, you project out a companys financials using assumptions for revenue growth, expenses and Working Capital; then you get down to Free Cash Flow for each year, which you then sum up and discount to a Net Present Value, based on your discount rate  usually the Weighted Average Cost of Capital.  Once you have the present value of the Cash Flows, you determine the companys Terminal Value, using either the Multiples Method or the Gordon Growth Method, and then also discount that back to its Net Present Value using WACC.  Finally, you add the two together to determine the companys Enterprise Value. "
2,DCF,Basic,Walk me through how you get from Revenue to Free Cash Flow in the projections. ,"Subtract COGS and Operating Expenses to get to Operating Income (EBIT).  Then, multiply by (1  Tax Rate), add back Depreciation and other non-cash charges, and subtract Capital Expenditures and the change in Working Capital.  Note: This gets you to Unlevered Free Cash Flow since you went off EBIT rather than EBT. You should confirm that this is what the interviewer is asking for.  "
3,DCF,Basic,"Whats an alternate way to calculate Free Cash Flow aside from taking Net Income, adding back Depreciation, and subtracting Changes in Operating Assets / Liabilities and CapEx?","Take Cash Flow From Operations and subtract CapEx  that gets you to Levered Cash Flow. To get to Unlevered Cash Flow, you then need to add back the tax-adjusted Interest Expense and subtract the tax-adjusted Interest Income."
4,DCF,Basic,Why do you use 5 or 10 years for DCF projections?,"Thats usually about as far as you can reasonably predict into the future.  Less than 5 years would be too short to be useful, and over 10 years is too difficult to predict for most companies."
5,DCF,Basic,What do you usually use for the discount rate?,"Normally you use WACC (Weighted Average Cost of Capital), though you might also use Cost of Equity depending on how youve set up the DCF."
6,DCF,Basic,How do you calculate WACC?,"The formula is: Cost of Equity * (% Equity) + Cost of Debt * (% Debt) * (1  Tax Rate) + Cost of Preferred * (% Preferred).  In all cases, the percentages refer to how much of the companys capital structure is taken up by each component.  For Cost of Equity, you can use the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM  see the next question) and for the others you usually look at comparable companies/debt issuances and the interest rates and yields issued by similar companies to get estimates."
7,DCF,Basic,How do you calculate the Cost of Equity?,"Cost of Equity = Risk-Free Rate + Beta * Equity Risk Premium  The risk-free rate represents how much a 10-year or 20-year US Treasury should yield; Beta is calculated based on the riskiness of Comparable Companies and the Equity Risk Premium is the % by which stocks are expected to out-perform risk-less assets.  Normally you pull the Equity Risk Premium from a publication called Ibbotsons.  Note: This formula does not tell the whole story.  Depending on the bank and how precise you want to be, you could also add in a size premium and industry premium to account for how much a company is expected to out-perform its peers is according to its market cap or industry.  Small company stocks are expected to out-perform large company stocks and certain industries are expected to out-perform others, and these premiums reflect these expectations."
8,DCF,Basic,How do you get to Beta in the Cost of Equity calculation?,"You look up the Beta for each Comparable Company (usually on Bloomberg), un-lever each one, take the median of the set and then lever it based on your companys capital structure.  Then you use this Levered Beta in the Cost of Equity calculation.  For your reference, the formulas for un-levering and re-levering Beta are below:  Un-Levered Beta = Levered Beta / (1 + ((1 - Tax Rate) x (Total Debt/Equity))) Levered Beta = Un-Levered Beta x (1 + ((1 - Tax Rate) x (Total Debt/Equity)))"
9,DCF,Basic,Why do you have to un-lever and re-lever Beta?,"Again, keep in mind our apples-to-apples theme.  When you look up the Betas on Bloomberg (or from whatever source youre using) they will be levered to reflect the debt already assumed by each company.  But each companys capital structure is different and we want to look at how risky a company is regardless of what % debt or equity it has.  To get that, we need to un-lever Beta each time.  But at the end of the calculation, we need to re-lever it because we want the Beta used in the Cost of Equity calculation to reflect the true risk of our company, taking into account its capital structure this time. "
10,DCF,Basic,Would you expect a manufacturing company or a technology company to have a higher Beta?," A technology company, because technology is viewed as a riskier industry than manufacturing.  "
11,DCF,Basic,Lets say that you use Levered Free Cash Flow rather than Unlevered Free Cash Flow in your DCF  what is the effect? ,"Levered Free Cash Flow gives you Equity Value rather than Enterprise Value, since the cash flow is only available to equity investors (debt investors have already been paid with the interest payments)."
12,DCF,Basic," If you use Levered Free Cash Flow, what should you use as the Discount Rate?","You would use the Cost of Equity rather than WACC since were not concerned with Debt or Preferred Stock in this case  were calculating Equity Value, not Enterprise Value."
13,DCF,Basic, How do you calculate the Terminal Value?,"You can either apply an exit multiple to the companys Year 5 EBITDA, EBIT or Free Cash Flow (Multiples Method) or you can use the Gordon Growth method to estimate its value based on its growth rate into perpetuity.  The formula for Terminal Value using Gordon Growth is: Terminal Value = Year 5 Free Cash Flow * (1 + Growth Rate) / (Discount Rate  Growth Rate)."
14,DCF,Basic,Why would you use Gordon Growth rather than the Multiples Method to calculate the Terminal Value?,"  In banking, you almost always use the Multiples Method to calculate Terminal Value in a DCF.  Its much easier to get appropriate data for exit multiples since they are based on Comparable Companies  picking a long-term growth rate, by contrast, is always a shot in the dark.  However, you might use Gordon Growth if you have no good Comparable Companies or if you have reason to believe that multiples will change significantly in the industry several years down the road.  For example, if an industry is very cyclical you might be better off using long-term growth rates rather than exit multiples."
15,DCF,Basic, Whats an appropriate growth rate to use when calculating the Terminal Value?,"Normally you use the countrys long-term GDP growth rate, the rate of inflation, or something similarly conservative.  For companies in mature economies, a long-term growth rate over 5% would be quite aggressive since most developed economies are growing at less than 5% per year."
16,DCF,Basic, How do you select the appropriate exit multiple when calculating Terminal Value?,"Normally you look at the Comparable Companies and pick the median of the set, or something close to it.  As with almost anything else in finance, you always show a range of exit multiples and what the Terminal Value looks like over that range rather than picking one specific number.  So if the median EBITDA multiple of the set were 8x, you might show a range of values using multiples from 6x to 10x."
17,DCF,Basic, Which method of calculating Terminal Value will give you a higher valuation?,"Its hard to generalize because both are highly dependent on the assumptions you make. In general, the Multiples Method will be more variable than the Gordon Growth method because exit multiples tend to span a wider range than possible long-term growth rates. "
18,DCF,Basic,Whats the flaw with basing terminal multiples on what public company comparables are trading at?,  The median multiples may change greatly in the next 5-10 years so it may no longer be accurate by the end of the period youre looking at. This is why you normally look at a wide range of multiples and do a sensitivity to see how the valuation changes over that range.  This method is particularly problematic with cyclical industries (e.g. semiconductors).
19,DCF,Basic, How do you know if your DCF is too dependent on future assumptions?,"The standard answer: if significantly more than 50% of the companys Enterprise Value comes from its Terminal Value, your DCF is probably too dependent on future assumptions. In reality, almost all DCFs are too dependent on future assumptions  its actually quite rare to see a case where the Terminal Value is less than 50% of the Enterprise Value.  But when it gets to be in the 80-90% range, you know that you may need to re-think your assumptions"
20,DCF,Basic,Should Cost of Equity be higher for a $5 billion or $500 million market cap company?," It should be higher for the $500 million company, because all else being equal, smaller companies are expected to outperform large companies in the stock market (and therefore be more risky).  Using a Size Premium in your calculation would also ensure that Cost of Equity is higher for the $500 million company."
21,DCF,Basic, What about WACC  will it be higher for a $5 billion or $500 million company?,"This is a bit of a trick question because it depends on whether or not the capital structure is the same for both companies.  If the capital structure is the same in terms of percentages and interest rates and such, then WACC should be higher for the $500 million company for the same reasons as mentioned above.  If the capital structure is not the same, then it could go either way depending on how much debt/preferred stock each one has and what the interest rates are."
22,DCF,Basic, Whats the relationship between debt and Cost of Equity?,"More debt means that the company is more risky, so the companys Levered Beta will be higher  all else being equal, additional debt would raise the Cost of Equity, and less debt would lower the Cost of Equity.  "
23,DCF,Basic,Cost of Equity tells us what kind of return an equity investor can expect for investing in a given company  but what about dividends? Shouldnt we factor dividend yield into the formula?,"  Trick question. Dividend yields are already factored into Beta, because Beta describes returns in excess of the market as a whole  and those returns include dividends."
24,DCF,Basic, How can we calculate Cost of Equity WITHOUT using CAPM?,There is an alternate formula:  Cost of Equity = (Dividends per Share / Share Price) + Growth Rate of Dividends  This is less common than the standard formula but sometimes you use it for companies where dividends are more important or when you lack proper information on Beta and the other variables that go into calculating Cost of Equity with CAPM.
25,DCF,Basic,"Two companies are exactly the same, but one has debt and one does not  which one will have the higher WACC?","This is tricky  the one without debt will have a higher WACC up to a certain point, because debt is less expensive than equity.  Why? Interest on debt is tax-deductible (hence the (1  Tax Rate) multiplication in the WACC formula).  Debt is senior to equity in a companys capital structure  debt holders would be paid first in a liquidation or bankruptcy.  Intuitively, interest rates on debt are usually lower than the Cost of Equity numbers you see (usually over 10%).  As a result, the Cost of Debt portion of WACC will contribute less to the total figure than the Cost of Equity portion will.  However, the above is true only to a certain point. Once a companys debt goes up high enough, the interest rate will rise dramatically to reflect the additional risk and so the Cost of Debt would start to increase  if it gets high enough, it might become higher than Cost of Equity and additional debt would increase WACC.  Its a U-shape curve where debt decreases WACC to a point, then starts increasing it."
26,DCF,Basic,Which has a greater impact on a companys DCF valuation  a 10% change in revenue or a 1% change in the discount rate? ,"You should start by saying, it depends but most of the time the 10% difference in revenue will have more of an impact. That change in revenue doesnt affect only the current years revenue, but also the revenue/EBITDA far into the future and even the terminal value."
27,DCF,Basic, What about a 1% change in revenue vs. a 1% change in the discount rate?,"In this case the discount rate is likely to have a bigger impact on the valuation, though the correct answer should start with, It could go either way, but most of the time"
28,DCF,Basic, How do you calculate WACC for a private company?,"This is problematic because private companies dont have market caps or Betas. In this case you would most likely just estimate WACC based on work done by auditors or valuation specialists, or based on what WACC for comparable public companies is."
29,DCF,Basic,What should you do if you dont believe managements projections for a DCF model?," You can take a few different approaches:   You can create your own projections.  You can modify managements projections downward to make them more conservative.  You can show a sensitivity table based on different growth rates and margins and show the values assuming managements projections and assuming a more conservative set of numbers.  In reality, youd probably do all of these if you had unrealistic projections."
30,DCF,Basic, Why would you not use a DCF for a bank or other financial institution?,"Banks use debt differently than other companies and do not re-invest it in the business  they use it to create their products  loans  instead. Also, interest is a critical part of banks business models and changes in working capital can be much larger than a banks net income  so traditional measures of cash flow dont tell you much.  For financial institutions, its more common to use a Dividend Discount Model or Residual Income Model instead of a DCF."
31,DCF,Basic, What types of sensitivity analyses would we look at in a DCF?,"Example sensitivities:   
Revenue Growth vs. Terminal Multiple 
EBITDA Margin vs. Terminal Multiple  
Terminal Multiple vs. Discount Rate  
Long-Term Growth Rate vs. Discount Rate  
And any combination of these (except Terminal Multiple vs. Long-Term Growth Rate, which would make no sense)."
32,DCF,Basic,A company has a high debt load and is paying off a significant portion of its principal each year. How do you account for this in a DCF?,"Trick question. You dont account for this at all in a DCF, because paying off debt principal shows up in Cash Flow from Financing on the Cash Flow Statement  but we only go down to Cash Flow from Operations and then subtract Capital Expenditures to get to Free Cash Flow.  If we were looking at Levered Free Cash Flow, then our interest expense would decline in future years due to the principal being paid off  but we still wouldnt count the principal repayments themselves anywhere.       "
1,DCF,Advanced,Explain why we would use the mid-year convention in a DCF. ,"You use it to represent the fact that a company’s cash flow does not come 100% at the end of each year – instead, it comes in evenly throughout each year.
In a DCF without mid-year convention, we would use discount period numbers of 1 for the first year, 2 for the second year, 3 for the third year, and so on.
With mid-year convention, we would instead use 0.5 for the first year, 1.5 for the second year, 2.5 for the third year, and so on."
2,DCF,Advanced,What discount period numbers would I use for the mid-year convention if I have a stub period – e.g. Q4 of Year 1 – in my DCF?,"The rule is that you divide the stub discount period by 2, and then you simply subtract 0.5 from the “normal” discount periods for the future years. Example for a Q4 stub:
           Normal Discount Periods with Stub:               Mid-Year Discount Periods with Stub: 
Q4                                 0.25                                                                                              0.125
Year1                           1.25                                                                                              0.75
Year2                           2.25                                                                                              1.75 
Year3                           3.25                                                                                              2.75
Year4                           4.25                                                                                              3.75

3,DCF,Advanced,How does the terminal value calculation change when we use the mid-year convention? ,"When you’re discounting the terminal value back to the present value, you use different numbers for the discount period depending on whether you’re using the Multiples Method or Gordon Growth Method:
• Multiples Method: You add 0.5 to the final year discount number to reflect the fact that you’re assuming the company gets sold at the end of the year. 
• Gordon Growth Method: You use the final year discount number as is, because you’re assuming the cash flows grow into perpetuity and that they are still received throughout the year rather than just at the end."
4,DCF,Advanced,"If I’m working with a public company in a DCF, how do I calculate its per-share value?","Once you get to Enterprise Value, ADD cash and then subtract debt, preferred stock, and minority interest (and any other debt-like items) to get to Equity Value.
Then, you need to use a circular calculation that takes into account the basic shares outstanding, options, warrants, convertibles, and other dilutive securities. It’s circular because the dilution from these depends on the per-share price – but the per-share price depends on number of shares outstanding, which depends on the per-share price.
To resolve this, you need to enable iterative calculations in Excel so that it can cycle through to find an approximate per-share price."
5,DCF,Advanced,Walk me through a Dividend Discount Model (DDM) that you would use in place of a normal DCF for financial institutions.,"The mechanics are the same as a DCF, but we use dividends rather than free cash flows:
1. Project out the company’s earnings, down to earnings per share (EPS).
2. Assume a dividend payout ratio – what percentage of the EPS actually gets paid out to shareholders in the form of dividends – based on what the firm has done historically and how much regulatory capital it needs.
3. Use this to calculate dividends over the next 5-10 years.
4. Do a check to make sure that the firm still meets its target Tier 1 Capital and other capital ratios – if not, reduce dividends.
5. Discount the dividend in each year to its present value based on Cost of Equity –NOT WACC – and then sum these up.
6. Calculate terminal value based on P / BV and Book Value in the final year, and then discount this to its present value based on Cost of Equity.
7. Sum the present value of the terminal value and the present values of the dividends to get the company’s net present per-share value."
6,DCF,Advanced,"When you’re calculating WACC, let’s say that the company has convertible debt. Do you count this as debt when calculating Levered Beta for the company?","Trick question. If the convertible debt is in-the-money then you do not count it as debt but instead assume that it contributes to dilution, so the company’s Equity Value is higher. If it’s out-of-the-money then you count it as debt and use the interest rate on the convertible for Cost of Debt."
7,DCF,Advanced,"We’re creating a DCF for a company that is planning to buy a factory for $100 in cash (no debt or other financing) in Year 4. Currently the present value of its Enterprise Value according to the DCF is $200. How would we change the DCF to account for the factory purchase, and what would our new Enterprise Value be?","
In this scenario, you would add CapEx spending of $100 in year 4 of the DCF, which would reduce Free Cash Flow for that year by $100. The Enterprise Value, in turn, would fall by the present value of that $100 decrease in Free Cash Flow.
The actual math here is messy but you would calculate the present value by dividing $100 by ((1 + Discount Rate)^4) – the “4” just represents year 4 here. Then you would subtract this amount from the Enterprise Value."
